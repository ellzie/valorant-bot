# valorant-bot

valorant-bot is a simple discord bot that can access [Henrik's unofficial valorant api](https://github.com/Henrik-3/unofficial-valorant-api) using [raimmanma's Python wrapper](https://github.com/raimannma/ValorantAPI) (check them both out).

Just a simple project I have been working on recently, want to keep the Python mind fresh.
